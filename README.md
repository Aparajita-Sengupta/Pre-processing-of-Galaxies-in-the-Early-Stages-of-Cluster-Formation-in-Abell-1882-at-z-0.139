Structural analysis of a cluster of galaxies.


•	Structural analysis using k-means clustering and identified a rare and dynamic large-scale structure.
•	Spectroscopic and photometric mapping.
•	Exploratory data analysis to probe evidence of environmental mechanisms driving galaxy transformations.
•	Qualitative and quantitative data analysis of large data sets using R-program, IDL, IRAF, applied   statistical & mathematical tools, photometry and spectroscopy.
